        == WRAPPER CLASSES ==

        These are classes that convert data types into objects.
        They wrap primitive data types into an object.

        Four important ones:
        Integer
            Integer ic = 7; // note the capital.

            int i = 10;
            Integer ii = i; // turned into an object.
        Double
        Boolean
        Character

        -Autoboxing-

        Automatic conversion between primitive data types and its respective
        wrapper classes.

        Not tested in the AP exam.

        -Additional methods-

        Converting int into String
            public String toString(int i);

        int i = 104;
        String ss = Integer.toString(i);

        An easier way...
        Appending an int type into an empty String.

        int j = 3;
        String s = "" + j; // s is set to "3"
